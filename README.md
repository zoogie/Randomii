# Randomii
- Generates QRs of randomized Miis, Gold Pants too! Just add "gold" as an argument when running the script. No "gold" gives regular Miis!
- Just open the index.html in your favorite browser after running the script to see all 20 crazy QRs! The script will first attempt to open the page automatically though.
- Needs the pycryptodome and qrcode (w/PIL) libraries installed (and Python3).
- The res folder contains debug plaintext binaries of all qrs for the curious.
- This is a side project of mine so don't expect me to maintain it or provide tech support. PRs are welcome.
