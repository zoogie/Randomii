# Randomii
- Generates QRs of randomized Miis. 
- Works 100% about 60% of the time (rerun script if you get a QR that the 3ds doesn't accept).
- Needs the Pycryptodomex and qrcode (w/PIL) libraries installed (and Python, of course).
- The 2 and 3 at the end of the script names denote which python version you need to run that particular script.
- This isn't a passion project of mine so don't expect me to maintain it or provide tech support. PRs are welcome.
